pci express revision 2.0

	1. upto 255 buses per system
	2. each bus can host up to 32 physical devices
        3. each phisical device can support upto 8 funtions

Device Configuration & capability data

	4. device contains 4k address region per functionality
	5. first 255 bytes to 4k space contain pci header 
         ( 64 byte generic config + 191 byte funtion specific						    capability register)
	6. rest of the address space contains device class specific registers


1. Adapter Driver: 
          - Runs at boot
	  - Physical bus scan and system resource assignment(irq, addresses)
	  - enumerate pci_dev object for each device and pci_bus object for each bus.
	  - each function in a multifuntion device is seen by kernel as saperate device. 

2. Mid layer
	  -- linux kernel pci management code
	  -- abstraction of pci protocol specific operations from high level drivers
	  -- provides abstract functions for power managment / data transfer and 
             other control operations
	  -- Provides an abstract interface for upper layer drivers and adapter driver.

3. High level driver
         -- register with pci mid layer
	 -- provide device specific operations
	 -- register driver with appropriate kernel subsystem/framework.


structre of  pci access code in a high level driver

1. Register with Mid layer(pci-core)
2. Enable Device( initiate power management op)
3. Set Dma addr size
4. Enable Bus mastering
5. Access Device system Resource information
6. Register irq
7. map device addresses
8. Communicate with device
