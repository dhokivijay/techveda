1. Linux kernel process scheduler implementation
	a) Core scheduling algorithm
	b) sched policy ( plugin)

sched policy (plugins):

   1. Priority preemptive fair share scheduler(SCHED_OTHER : general purpose 
      policy))
	- Default policy for all process and posix threads
	- operates on Dynamic priority and static priority zero(0).
	- scheduler assigns dynamic priority based on following factors
                 - amount of time process/thread is waiting for CPU
		 - nice value assigned
		 - Type of process/thread (I/O bound or CPU bound)
	- process/threads using this policy have un-determistic execution times.




   2. static priority preemptive scheduler(real-time policy)
	- operates strictly as per static priority assigned
	- priority range 1- 99( larger no increased prio)
	- highest priority first
	- process/threads using this policy can be deterministic(fixed time).
	- provides FIFO/RR modes to handle equal priority threads/processes
	        a. SCHED_RR: Round robin among equal priority
                b. SCHED_FIFO: FIFO among equal priority
